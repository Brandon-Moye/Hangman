# Hangman

This is a project in the works to have a functioning hangman game.

Currently it utilizes while/for loops and arrays indices.

I am able to generate a list of guessed letters that will display for the player. Currently I am trying to determine how to generate a just list of guessed letters that are incorrect. I have tried loops, .splice(), .pop(), and .push(). I feel like I should get it to work with one of these combos but will need more time to experiment with the code.

I began building this project focusing mainly on logic and most of it runs/ is displayed in the console.
My next steps will be building it using more HTML and CSS elements and have it functional on the page.
