# Hangman

This is a project in the works to have a functioning hangman game.

Currently it utilizes while/for loops and arrays indices.

I began building this project focusing mainly on logic and most of it runs/ is displayed in the console.
My next steps will be building it using more HTML and CSS elements and have it functional on the page.
